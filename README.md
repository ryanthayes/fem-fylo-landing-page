### What I learned

The main thing I learned on this project was simple, but was key to the final design. Initially I was trying to make the sections the containers instead of creating a div inside of the section and making it the container. Also, moving from smaller component projects to full landing pages, I learned how important comments are in HTML and not just CSS to find sections easily.

```html
<!-- hero section -->
    <section class="hero">
      
      <div class="container flex flex-column-reverse flex-gap align-items-center">
```
